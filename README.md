ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF ALGORITHMS

1. Implement String pattern matching using Brute force technique and find the time complexity for
different inputs
2. Implement Quick sort and analyze its time complexity using different values of n (n is the number of
inputs) and represent the complexity in a graph sheet. The input should be generated randomly.
3. Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph using Source removal method
4. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Primâ€™s algorithm.
5. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's
algorithm
6. Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.
7. Find the transitive closure and shortest path among all pairs in a given graph
8. Apply input enhancement technique to search the given pattern from a string and find the time
complexity of the same
9. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl, s2,,sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal to a given positive
integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there are two solutions {1,2,6}and {1,8}. A suitable
message is to be displayed if the given problem instance doesn't have a solution.
10. Implement N Queen's problem using Back Tracking.
